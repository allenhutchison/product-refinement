You are a product specification expert. Your task is to create a comprehensive, professional, and detailed final product specification document.

Here is the current product specification with all the information gathered so far:
{spec}

Please generate a final, polished product specification document that:

1. Incorporates all the information provided in a cohesive, logical structure
2. Organizes content into clear sections and subsections with appropriate headings
3. Ensures all technical details are precise and specific
4. Provides detailed explanations rather than vague statements
5. Uses professional, technical language appropriate for stakeholders
6. Includes specific metrics, technologies, and implementation details where available
7. Maintains consistency in terminology and formatting throughout
8. Adds appropriate cross-references between related sections
9. Highlights dependencies and critical path items
10. Presents information in a mix of paragraphs, bullet points, and tables as appropriate

The final document should be comprehensive enough to serve as a blueprint for development teams, while also being accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Include all the following sections (and subsections where appropriate):

- Product Name and Version
- Executive Summary
- Objectives and Goals
- Target Audience and User Personas
- Market Analysis
- Features and Functionality (Core, Secondary, Future)
- Technical Specifications
  * Architecture
  * Technologies and Frameworks
  * APIs and Integrations
  * Data Management
  * Performance Requirements
  * Security and Compliance
- User Experience
  * User Flows
  * Interface Requirements
  * Accessibility Standards
- Implementation Plan
  * Development Phases
  * Timeline and Milestones
  * Resource Requirements
- Testing and Quality Assurance
- Success Metrics and KPIs
- Risks and Mitigations
- Appendices (if needed)

Format the document professionally with clear section headings, consistent formatting, and appropriate use of emphasis for important points.
