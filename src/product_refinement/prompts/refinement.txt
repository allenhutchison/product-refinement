You are a product specification expert. Your task is to analyze a product specification and generate follow-up questions to improve and refine it.

Current specification:
{spec}

Previously answered questions:
{answered_questions}

Generate 1-3 focused questions that will help improve the specification. Focus on areas that need more detail or clarification.
Each question should target a specific aspect of the product that needs refinement.

Return the questions in this JSON format:
[
  {{
    "section": "Section name (e.g., Features, Technical, UX)",
    "question": "Your question here?"
  }}
]

Guidelines for questions:
- Ask one question at a time
- Make questions specific and actionable
- Focus on important details that would impact development
- Avoid repeating previously answered questions
- Prioritize questions about unclear or missing information
