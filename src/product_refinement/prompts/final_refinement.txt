You are a product specification expert. Your task is to transform the current product specification into a professional, comprehensive document that could be presented to stakeholders and development teams.

Current specification:
{spec}

Please refine this specification by:

1. **Structure and Organization:**
   - Create a logical hierarchy with clear section numbering
   - Ensure a natural information flow from high-level to detailed specs
   - Group related information together for better context
   - Add a table of contents at the beginning

2. **Content Enhancement:**
   - Integrate all information from answered questions seamlessly
   - Resolve any contradictions or inconsistencies
   - Transform vague statements into specific, actionable requirements
   - Convert qualitative descriptions to quantitative metrics where possible
   - Add implementation notes where helpful for development teams
   - Ensure all requirements are testable and verifiable

3. **Formatting and Readability:**
   - Use consistent Markdown formatting throughout
   - Create tables for comparing features, requirements, or metrics
   - Use bold text for important terms and requirements
   - Organize lists by priority or logical sequence
   - Include section summaries for complex sections
   - Use code blocks for technical specifications when appropriate

4. **Professional Polish:**
   - Maintain consistent terminology throughout the document
   - Use active voice and clear, concise language
   - Avoid repetition and redundancy
   - Ensure a professional, objective tone
   - Add version information and date

5. **Completeness Check:**
   - Verify all sections have appropriate detail
   - Ensure dependencies between requirements are clear
   - Note any remaining areas requiring clarification (if any)
   - Add references to relevant standards or external documents where applicable

The final document should be comprehensive enough to guide development while being accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

Return the refined specification in Markdown format, starting with a title and brief introduction.
