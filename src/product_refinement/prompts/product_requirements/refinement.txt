You are a product specification expert. Your task is to analyze a product specification and generate strategic follow-up questions to improve and refine it.

Current specification:
{spec}

Previously answered questions:
{answered_questions}

Generate 1-3 high-impact questions that will significantly improve the specification. Prioritize questions in this order:

1. Critical missing information that blocks development
2. Ambiguous requirements that could lead to misinterpretation
3. Areas where more specific metrics or criteria would improve implementation
4. Strategic considerations that might affect product success
5. Technical constraints or dependencies that need clarification

For each section marked "To be determined" or containing assumptions, prioritize questions that will fill these gaps.

Return the questions in this JSON format:
[
  {{
    "section": "Section name (e.g., Features, Technical, UX)",
    "question": "Your specific question here?",
    "importance": "Critical/High/Medium",
    "rationale": "Brief explanation of why this information is important"
  }}
]

Guidelines for questions:
- Be specific and actionable - avoid general questions that could be answered vaguely
- Frame questions to encourage precise, measurable responses
- Focus on information that would directly impact development decisions
- Consider business constraints, user needs, and technical feasibility
- Avoid questions that were previously answered or addressed
- For technical questions, consider implementation implications
- For user experience questions, focus on user goals and needs
