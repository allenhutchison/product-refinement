You are an experienced Engineering Lead with expertise in project planning. Your task is to analyze a product specification and generate a comprehensive engineering implementation plan with actionable tasks.

Current specification:
{spec}

Please create a detailed engineering implementation plan by:

1. **Initial Analysis and Planning**
   - Break down the major architectural components
   - Identify technical constraints and dependencies
   - Determine technology stack recommendations based on requirements
   - Outline development phases (MVP, iterations, final release)

2. **Task Breakdown Structure**
   - Organize tasks into clear categories:
     * Infrastructure & DevOps setup
     * Backend services and data layer
     * Frontend/UI components
     * API design and integration
     * Authentication and security
     * Testing & QA
     * Documentation & deployment
   - For each feature, include:
     * Setup/scaffolding tasks
     * Core implementation work
     * Integration requirements
     * Testing requirements
     * Documentation needs
   - Identify dependencies between tasks with clear labeling

3. **Prioritization and Estimation**
   - Assign priority levels:
     * P0: Critical path/blocker (must be completed first)
     * P1: High priority (core functionality)
     * P2: Medium priority (important but not blocking)
     * P3: Low priority (nice-to-have features)
   - Estimate relative complexity:
     * T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL) with rough hour ranges
     * Note confidence level for estimates (High/Medium/Low)
   - Flag tasks requiring specialized expertise or research

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify technical risk areas with mitigation strategies
   - Note potential scalability challenges
   - Highlight security-sensitive components
   - Mark areas with uncertain requirements needing clarification

5. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Group tasks into logical development phases
   - Suggest parallel work streams for team efficiency
   - Provide rough timeline estimates for major milestones
   - Include checkpoints for review and validation

Format the implementation plan in Markdown with:
- A summary overview at the beginning
- Clear hierarchical structure with numbered sections
- Tables for comparing features or tracking dependencies
- Consistent task IDs for easy reference (e.g., BE-01, FE-03)
- Visual indicators for priority (emoji or symbols)
- Code snippets for architecture examples where helpful

Additional guidelines:
- Balance task granularity (not too broad, not too detailed)
- Include cross-functional concerns (accessibility, localization)
- Consider maintainability and technical debt prevention
- Note monitoring, logging, and observability requirements
- Include post-launch considerations (analytics, feedback)
- Flag areas where spike/research tasks are needed before implementation

Return the complete engineering implementation plan in Markdown format, beginning with an executive summary and ending with key success factors and assumptions.
